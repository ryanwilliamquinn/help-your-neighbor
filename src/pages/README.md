# Pages Directory

This directory will contain the main page components for the application:

- `LoginPage.tsx` - User authentication
- `DashboardPage.tsx` - Main app interface showing requests
- `CreateRequestPage.tsx` - Form for creating new requests
- `GroupManagementPage.tsx` - Managing group members and invites
- `ProfilePage.tsx` - User profile management

Each page component will be responsible for:

- Layout and overall page structure
- Coordinating between multiple components
- Handling page-level state management
- Managing URL parameters and routing (when we add React Router)
